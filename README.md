 Description: [Design random number generator with some rules
              Input:
                   a) inputDigit: Indicates how many numbers are able to generate.
                   
              Random numbers:
                 Digits are 0-9. Total count of digits will be any positive number.
 			             Count difference of each digit must always equal or one.
 			             Value difference of two digits next to each other must be always 
  			            higher than 1.
                   
  		          Example:
                 Total count: 23
 			             random digits: 68395627408491506273941
         		      count of each digit: 2x (0,1,2,3,5,7,8), 3x (4,6,9)
 
              Print:
